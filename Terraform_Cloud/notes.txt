Terraform Cloud is an alternative to "s3 bucket + dynamo db" on aws,
for storing and locking securely the terraform tfstate file after applying terraform configuration files...

*** Workspaces must be created in order to store the state file in terraform cloud...
    worspaces can be defined for specifiv env like dev, staging,and production...
    The same code base can be leveraged and used accross multiple worspaces...


commands to run for deploying infrastructure 
              1-in Dev env: 
                               - terraform init -backend-config=dev.hcl
                               - terraform plan
                               - terraform apply
               2-in Prod env:
                                - terraform init -backend-config=prod.hcl -reconfigure
                                - terraform plan
                                - terraform apply
NB: "-reconfigure" because we still in the same directory used for deploying dev infrastructure,
     and we need to reconfigure the backend and the state file for prod env....
